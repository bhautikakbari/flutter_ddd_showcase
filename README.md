# Flutter GitHub Profile - Clean Architecture with DDD & CQRS

A demonstration project showcasing Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns in a Flutter application. This project uses the GitHub API to display user profiles and repositories.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a practical example of implementing advanced architectural patterns in Flutter. 

It demonstrates:
- Clean Architecture principles
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts
- CQRS pattern implementation
- Proper error handling
- Dependency injection
- State management with BLoC pattern


## 🌟 Features

- Search GitHub users
- View user profiles
- Display user repositories
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Clean and maintainable codebase
- Separation of concerns
- Testable architecture

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Flutter
- Dart
- flutter_bloc for state management
- get_it for dependency injection
- dartz for functional programming
- http for API calls

## 🏛️ Architecture Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- Clear separation of domain logic
- Use of Value Objects for type-safety
- Rich domain models
- Bounded contexts
- Ubiquitous language


### CQRS Pattern

- Separation of read and write operations
- Commands for write operations
- Queries for read operations
- Better scalability and maintenance


### Clean Architecture

- Independence of frameworks
- Testability
- Separation of concerns
- Dependency rule (dependencies point inward)
